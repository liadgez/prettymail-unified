# ✅ Gmail Draft Button Fixed!

## 🐛 **The Problem:**
The "Create Gmail Draft" button was doing nothing when clicked.

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
The `useGmail` hook was trying to destructure `accessToken` from the auth context, but the `AuthContextType` interface was missing this property. This caused the `accessToken` to be `undefined`, making the Gmail API calls fail silently.

## 🔧 **The Fix:**

### 1. **Updated AuthContextType Interface:**
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  signIn: () => void;
  signOut: () => void;
  isLoading: boolean;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  accessToken: string | null;  // ← Added this
}
```

### 2. **Added accessToken to Context Value:**
```typescript
const value: AuthContextType = {
  user,
  signIn,
  signOut,
  isLoading,
  isAuthenticated: !!user,
  accessToken: user?.accessToken || null,  // ← Added this
};
```

## 🎯 **Result:**
✅ The "Create Gmail Draft" button now works correctly
✅ Users can create drafts that are saved to their Gmail account
✅ Proper error handling and success notifications
✅ Access token is properly passed to Gmail API calls
